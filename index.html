  <p> My name is Irene Chamorro-Beckenhauer and I am a current junior at UT Austin majoring in </p>
  <p>  Interactive Design with minors in Computer Science, Business, and English. Now you may </p>
  <p>  be asking, why is her name so long? Why does she have 3 minors? To answer </p>
  <p> the first question: blame my parents. For the second, I came into college as a design</p1>
  <p>      major hoping to transfer to English, as Iâ€™ve always had an affinity for writing</p>
  <p>      and reading. Instead, I developed an interest in programming and  </p>
  <p>   web design, and fell in love with the growing feild of internet art.  I never</p>
  <p> felt especially compelled to work with computers, but then I realized   </p>
  <p> the magnitude of importance that programming has on anything that has been   </p>
  <p>    or will be created. With the combination of an eye for design, computing skills, and the </p>
  <p> ability to communicate and command, I hope to play this hand well for anything that comes along. </p>
